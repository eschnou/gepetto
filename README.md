[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


**Gepetto** is a minimalistic cli-based Operator: an AI Agent that uses its own browser to perform tasks for you.
The primary use case is running browser test cases, but it could be used for any other task automation needs. It
supports a wide variety of AI models and can leverage any tools exposed through MCP.

## üõ†Ô∏èÔ∏è Key Features

- Execute a task described in natural language
- Sequential step processing, only proceed to next step if previous succeeded
- Reporting task results in JUnit XML
- Support a wide variety of LLM (gpt, claude, ollama, etc..)
- Supports MCP to connect to third party actions providers

## üèóÔ∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/eschnou/gepetto.git
cd gepetto

# Build executable JAR
./mvnw clean package

# Install Playwright MCP
npm install @playwright/mcp
npx playwright install
npx playwright install chrome

# Run locally without installing
./gepetto help

# Or install to system (requires sudo)
sudo ./install.sh
```

## üïπÔ∏èUsage

By default, Gepetto uses OpenAI gpt-4o as LLM. You therefore need an API key defined
either as en environment variable or in a .env file.

```bash
# Export your Openai key (check documentation to use other providers)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***

# Alternate is to store it in a .env file
echo OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-*** > .env

# Initialize a new project
gepetto init

# Run a task file
gepetto run gepetto/tasks/login.gpt
```

### Task File Format

```
# Task Name
description: "Description of the task"
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
author: "Author Name"
created: "2025-03-15"

Test:
  Visit ${HOSTNAME}.
  Navigate to the login page.
  Login with username ${USERNAME} and password ${PASSWORD}.
  Verify user is logged in and on the main dashboard.
  Click the logout button.
  Verify you are back to the login page.
```

### Variables

Gepetto supports variables in task files using the `${VARIABLE}` syntax. Variables allow your 
tasks to be reusable across different environments and scenarios.

Variables can be defined from two sources:

1. **Configuration file** - Stored in `gepetto/config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   variables:
     HOSTNAME: "example.com"
     USERNAME: "testuser"
   ```

2. **Command line arguments** - Using the `--var` or `-v` flag:
   ```bash
   gepetto run task.gpt --var PASSWORD=secret123
   ```

## üîßConfiguration

### LLM Configuration

Gepetto is built with [OpenGPA](https://github.com/eschnou/OpenGPA), an open source agentic orchestration
framework built in Java. It is built on top of [Spring AI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/index.html) and thus
supports many different Chat Models. Do refer to the OpenGPA and Spring documentation to configure Gepetto to your needs.

### Playwright Configuration

Gepetto is controlling a browser using Playwright over the MCP protocol. For details
on the Playwright configuration and caching; visit their [plugin documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp.

Playwright MCP will launch Chrome browser with the new profile, located at
- `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\mcp-chrome-profile` on Windows
- `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-profile` on macOS
- `~/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-profile` on Linux

All the logged in information will be stored in that profile, you can delete it between 
sessions if you'd like to clear the offline state.

### Running headless on a server

If you want to run Gepetto on a server (without UI) in headless mode, you need to modify the MCP
configuration at `src/main/resources/mcp-config.json` and then rebuild the application.

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--headless"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èDevelopment
